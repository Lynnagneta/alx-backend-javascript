What is a Promise in JavaScript?
A Promise is like a container for a future value — something your code will get later (like a response from a server). 
It’s called a “promise” because it promises to return something… eventually.

Summary you can tell someone:
Promises help us write code that waits for stuff like API calls without freezing everything.
Use .then() to handle success, .catch() for errors.
Use async/await to write cleaner, easier-to-read async code.
Use try/catch to catch and handle errors.
The Promise object has helpful methods like resolve, reject, all, race, any, and allSettled.
